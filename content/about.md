Hi, my name is Pieter Jan Geutjens

Mid 2017, after a career of over 10 years as a freelance SCCM consultant, I decided it was time for something new.. I had been
building automated software installers, designing, setting up and operating SCCM infrastructure, and I realised I did not see
myself doing that for the next 10 years, so it was time for some soul-searching.

This lead me to conclude that the parts of IT that are most rewarding and interesting to me are all situated in the playing field 
between people and processes. They are about finding solutions that make some _thing_, some _process_, go smoother, 
faster and more efficiently, allowing _somebody_ to get their work faster, with fewer errors, better.. That's where I really find joy and satisfaction. 
Once that was clear it took about a day to get bitten by a new bug; a new goal..  DevOps

So I decided to refocus and laid out a learning path geared towards expanding my skill as a developer, learning about automation,
kanban, continuous improvement, Lean Enterprise and a list of other topics. Hopefully this will allow me to find new challenges both 
personally and professionally!

Leanfield.io is where I will document things I run into and learn on this journey.
